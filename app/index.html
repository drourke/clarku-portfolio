              <img src="./images/DtoR-loop.gif" alt="full looping gif" class="img-responsive" id="dtor-gif">
              <p class="text-justify">The goal for this first project was to create an animated tween between the letters D and R (my initials). It was built using Adobe Flash. The initial tween started from converting the two letters from a font to smart objects, and applying the built in and &lsquo;create shape tween&rsquo; function. I used shape hints at the start and end to refine how adobe chose to transform the letter. To make the final GIF pause at the end of each cycle I took the last frame from the transition and duplicated it ~30 times in order to control the timing ratio between the animation and pause.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">For this project the goal was to create an animated transition between two antonyms. The project the animation was built in Photoshop, using the timeline to create a simple animation. Photoshop provides a somewhat limited suite of animation tools, which made for an interesting challenge when trying to smooth out and manage the timing of the animation.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">To illustrate the shift between words I started from a single rigid rectangle, on a plain white background. The scene collapses downwards, and softer, more abstract shapes transition in to fill the frame. The font choice was also intended to represent the shift which took place, along with the color shift from black to varying shades of blue.</p>

              <h2 class="portfolio-row-title">Animated Quote</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">For this project we had to take a quote that we personally liked or found interesting, and animate it. I chose a Mike Tyson quote which I had always liked. Since the animation was supposed to be built using the quite itself, I animated the quote entering the frame and animating what I felt to be the actions the words would take on.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">The animation was built using Photoshop. Since Photoshop doesn't have any easing functionality built in I spent a lot of time playing with the speed of the words as the enter the scene and interact. It was interesting getting to look closely at what makes an animation run smoothly and feel organic. Since I was animating each word individually I had look closely at the word spacing and alignment, which is something that I had taken for granted in the past.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">For this final project we had to select a film and animate a title sequence introducing the film. I chose to animate a sequence for the movie In Bruges, which is a dark comedy about two hitmen hiding out in Bruges after a job goes south. I wanted my title sequence to capture the atmosphere of the movie, and used slower more classical music along with slow, fade-in-out transitions between each shot of the sequence.</p>
