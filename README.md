clarku-portfolio
================

Portfolio website made as part of a final project for Motion Graphics. I wanted to try using yeoman, and ended up using https://github.com/yeoman/generator-mobile to create the scaffolding. The real advantage I found was having the pre-configured Grunt file, everything else was probably just slight overkill for what the project goals where.
